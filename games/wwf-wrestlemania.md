## Basic Moves
### punch:         P
Your basic, normal, punch. If you hit punch repeatedly while you are right
next to someone, you will sometimes do a mini combo, which ends with you
throwing your opponent.

### power punch:   PP
A more powerful punch.  With most of the characters, various extensions to the
arm will appear. I will note this in the individual character description.

### kick:          K
Your basic, normal, kick.  You may can do a few mini-combos with this.

### power kick:    PK
A more powerful kick.  With most characters, you can also have various
extensions similarly to the power punches.

### run:           P+K
After executing the run, you hold down the buttons and you can choose which
direction to run in (left or right).  Much more intuitive than a badly placed
run button in another Midway game.  Also, any moves done after bouncing off
the ropes are considered High Risk, and do double damage.

### power throw:   PP+PK (some characters)
Only Bam Bam Bigelow, Lex Luger, and Yokozuna have this throw.  This throw can
be blocked, but once hit by it, you cannot reverse this.  Razor Ramon also
has a version of this and his is done with FF K.  It is also non reversible.

### hair grab:     PP (near opponents head while on the ground)
After doing certain knock down moves, you can pick up your opponent from the
canvas and possibly inflict even more damage.

### grab:          FF PP
This is the normal grab.  After doing a grab, you have the option of doing
a High Risk Move, mini combo, or true combo.  This move can be blocked,
but the timing can be tricky.

- High Risk Move #1:  FF PP
- High Risk Move #2:  DD PK

### hip toss:      BB P
This is very key and to get good at this game will require that you use this
effectively.  This move can be blocked, however you have to press block to
block it (you just can't hold block down forever).  Every wrestler has this
move.

### rope toss:     BB PP
This move throws them towards the ropes where the opposing character is
vulnerable to an open attack until he recovers.  This move has its uses here
and there for it leaves your opponent running helplessly.  More effective
if you are in the center of the ring.  Many times, if you are very close to
your opponent, this move will execute a hip toss instead.

### shove:         BL+P
This moves shoves a guy away from you.  This is quite good for getting people
away from you to give yourself a little more space.  I'm not sure if it does
damage or not to an opponent.  I will try to pay more attention next time.

### turnbuckle leap:
Climb up on the turnbuckle.  Go ahead, it's fun.  While this move cannot be
blocked, you can get hit while on the turnbuckle *and* as you come down.  A
good counter is a power grab.  Also, running away from someone leaping from
the turnbuckle is a relatively "safe" move.  You can also jump on people out of
the ring with this, except Yokozuna.  You cannot block while on the turnbuckle,
and if you are hit, you sometimes get knocked out of the ring.  After leaping
from the turnbuckle, you can steer your character around before he lands.

### flying drop kick:     run+PK
This move lets you run, then execute a flying attack.  This move is quite
useful and has a good surprising factor.

### flying body dive:     run+PP
Very useful just like the drop kick.

### reverse throw: (FF PP, DD PK, etc.)
Very necessary for surviving in this game.  Also, vital for defensive play.
You perform a reversal with the same motion as you would execute a High
Risk Move after you grab your opponent.

### power up:      spin joystick 720 away from opponent
Everyone can power up by spinning the joystick. You can only do it once
per match, however.  Helps to hold down block.  After doing the motion, you
will do a taunt.  After doing this move, if you can attack your opponent
within the next 5 seconds, it will do 4x damage with the notable exception of
a super combo.  (doing a super combo + 4x damage would be quite unfair).

### speed up:      spin joystick 720 towards opponent
You can also do a speed up also.  You may be able to do this one multiple
times however.  After doing this move, your character will flash for a brief
second.  For the next 7 seconds or so, your character will be able to move
faster.

### throw:         B+PP
This throw will counter your opponent out of his run.  Must be extremely close
for this to work.  Not too useful as most opponent lunge at you and would be
kicking you.

- #### grab) FF PP
This is the normal grab that everyone has.  Tap forward twice and hitting
power punch will attempt to grab the opponent.  It's the most important
move in the game.  Without it, you can't do supercombos or any throws (unless
you were grabbed).

- #### power throw) PP PK
Some big characters have power throws.  These throws are unique for they hold
them up in the air, then slam them down.  What makes these throws really
good, is that they are NOT reversible.  You can't counter a power throw,
so a character who has a power throw is good.  Yoko, Lex, and BamBam are
the characters who have power throws.  Also, Razor Ramon has a quad power
throw.  ouch!

- #### hip toss) BB P
Whipback throw, also known as a snap mirror (whatever that means).  It's an
over the shoulder kind of throw.  Also, this throw is quick and hard to block
and is good for switching sides.

- #### rope toss) BB PP
This slings your opponent against the rope, leaving him helplessly running
for a brief period of time.  You can follow this up with an attack of your
own.  You can get original on this one especially when fighting outside
of the ring.  Running into walls outside of the ring does damage!  Throw them
against the railings and especially the side of the ring where you can corner
them and follow up with a combination.  If really close, sometimes this motion
will do a hip toss instead.

- #### sling) B+PP
Not much known about this one.  If up very close, this maneuver will do
a hip toss.

## Super Combos
Super combos are done by first grabbing your opponent (FF PP), and then
performing a "combo initiator" move.  Then after doing this, precise timing
between pre-programmed button sequences will execute the combo.

### Combos Example

- (punches/kicks)
- (more punches/kicks)
- (slam)
- (more slams)
- (special move)

#### Bret Hart's 16-hit combo:

1. do a grab (FF PP)
2. now do the PK initiator (FF PK)
3. tap PK and bret hart will start by kicking 5 times.
4. around the 5th kick, tap PP
5. bret hart with throw 5 punches.  start tapping P
6. bret will do a body slam.  as soon the bret finishes the first body
slam, tap K
7. bret hart will do 2 more body slams.  tap PK after the 3rd body slam
8. bret hart now will do 3 back breakers.  16-hit combo.

The combo notation looks like this:

- (grab), FF PK PP P K PK

Examples of mini combos include:

- Grab with Bret Hart.  Hold the joystick forward and tap P.
- Grab with Razor Ramon.  Hold the joystick up and tap P.
- Grab with Shawn Michaels.  Hold the joystick forward and tap PK.
