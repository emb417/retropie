# Retropie Setup and Configs

Planning to use this as a place to store any custom setup and configs.  

## Hardware
* Rpi3 Model B
* Apple Keyboard via USB
  * thinking about a mini keyboard for portability
  * primarily ssh into pi anyways
* [PS3 Controller via Bluetooth](controllers/ps3.cfg)
* [Mayflash F300 Fightstick via USB](controllers/mayflash.cfg)
  * w/Sanwa Octagonal Restrictor Plate (much easier for arcade controls)
* Smraza All Black Case, Heatsinks and Fan
  * 3D printed plates are inexpensive, but not cheap per se
  * would love to try an aluminum or molded case

## Software
* Many Arcade games (mame-libretro, mame2003 and pifba)
* Few NES faves: Tetris, Zelda, Castlevania
* Oregon Trail (2 Disks) on Apple 2 (linapple)
